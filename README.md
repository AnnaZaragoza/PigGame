## General Information
Very simple game for 2 players that have to fight for the highest number. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 wins.


## Features
- Rolling the dice
- Switching players
- Holding scores
- Resetting the game
